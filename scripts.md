# Script Preparation
#### A CS Online Guide

**A good video lesson begins with a good script.** Writing this script
involves the same skills you might use to produce a great academic
paper: understanding your audience, establishing whatever background
is needed (and not more), making your point with arguments, math,
examples, and whatever else is necessary (and not more).

**Use graphics.** The script involves not only arranging the words
you'll say, but also graphic elements like diagrams and equations. The
graphics are often the best way to communicate an idea. They might
take more time for you to construct than a block of text, but students
can interpret and internalize information from a well-made graphic
much more efficiently.

**Have only one thing to say.** If the script has only one main point,
there are several beneficial consequences:

1. The result will be short, hopefully only a few minutes long. This
   supports the student activity of going back and re-watching content
   on specific topics.
1. A video with a short script is easier to re-record if mistakes are
   made. This reduces your effort and improves the student experience.
1. Short videos are easier to finalize in post-production.
1. Short videos can be rearranged more easily if their content is
   decoupled.
1. Similarly, it makes it easier to add new videos later on to
   supplement existing videos.

**Use complete sentences.** Writing complete sentences forces the
author to issue complete thoughts. When recording lectures, those
complete sentences can be read with ease: no pauses as you try to
figure out what should be said with the queue _"introduce recursion
here"_, no stammering as you search for the right word, no repeating
yourself as you realize the previous utterance was awkward. 

_Writing complete sentences clarifies your speech, improves the
quality of content delivery, and yields a professional result._

**Support reading.** A secondary use of a well-written script is to
support students reading the text, possibly without the video
running. However, keep in mind that the script is meant to be spoken
over time with graphics, so it resembles a screenplay more than a
textbook. Unless the content is graphic-centric, the script will still
let students get a good sense of what is being said. This supports
students to study when they can't watch videos (e.g. at work, on the
bus). It also supports text-based searching. E.g. which lectures
mention "inference"?

### Recommendations

**Be conversational.** It is easier for students to interpret spoken
language if it is delivered in a conversational tone, rather than in
formal academic language. 

**Script assets can be kept in source control.** I use Git to store
all of my lecture material, and strongly suggest that others do the
same. This makes your work more accessible, and encourages there to be
a single place to collaborate over course artifacts.

Git isn't just for text! Binary elements (graphics, OmniGraffle,
Photoshop files) can be kept in Git using LFS support. Last, services
like BitBucket and GitHub will render markdown files nicely for
read-only viewing. Moodle will render Markdown files as well, so you
only need to paste them in.
