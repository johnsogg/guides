# Slides and Graphics
#### A CS Online Guide

A video's visuals are critically important for conveying the
narrative. There might be diagrams, code, equations, pictures,
sketches, handwriting, etc., and I'll collectively call these _the
slides_.

Remember that *information consumes attention*. You want your students
to pay attention to what is relevant so the intended information is
relayed. If there are irrelevant visual elements on their screen they
might consume those instead, and miss whatever point you were trying
to make.

We are not likely to be professional graphic designers, but that
doesn't absolve us of the responsibility to clearly communicate with
graphics.

Here are some guidelines:

* **Reduce noise.** Avoid needless lines, shadows, colors, and
  text. If you can remove an element without removing meaning, do
  it. Edit mercilessly.
* **Be consistent.** Unless there is a meaningful reason to use
  different line weights, fonts, colors, etc., strive for consistency.
* **Be legible.** Viewers will watch the lecture clips on phones, or
  small embedded rectangles in a web page. Be sure your graphics are
  understandable under those conditions.
* **Use widescreen slides.** If you have a modern display, it is
  likely that you'll record in a widescreen format. Make the most of
  the screen's space by using slides that match it. For Keynote, I
  recommend 16:9 format.
* **Avoid animation.** It is tempting to use animations and visual
  effects, but these generally distract viewers' attention. I almost
  exclusively use a subtle fade in/out for my builds because it is
  less abrupt (and therefore distracting) than a simple appearance
  effect.
* **Draw attention to the relevant.** If your slide has a bunch of
  information on it, and you want to call out some particular part,
  use some technique to call attention to what you're talking
  about. This can be as simple as waving the mouse around. I typically
  use colors: irrelevant parts are faded out with light gray, relevant
  parts are colored and bolded.
